# Video Files

Place your video files here:

- Name your video files according to the entries in `src/main.js`
- By default, the system looks for: `visual1.mp4`, `visual2.mp4`, `visual3.mp4`, and `visual4.mp4`
- Videos should be in MP4 format for best browser compatibility
- Videos will automatically play and loop when the page loads
- Videos are muted by default to allow autoplay in most browsers

Note: Large video files might take longer to load. Consider optimizing your videos for web usage.
